If you want to run static program, you need to:
1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3/
2. Comment or delete "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
3. Re-built the project.

If you want to built library or run tests of dynamic program, you need to:
1. For library:
    1.1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3/external/
    1.2. Add "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
    1.3. Re-built library. Be careful not to mix a static project with a dynamic library!
2. For tests:
    2.1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3/GTESTS/
    2.2. Add "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
    2.3. Re-built tests. Be careful not to mix a static tests with a dynamic library or a dynamic tests with a static library!

If you read this, I hope you will suggest more simple way of organisation of that type of programs :)
