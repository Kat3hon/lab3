Третья лабораторная работа третьего семестра этого курса. Описание моего задания и общего задания можно найти в папке с лабой. Ниже описание запуска программы :)

Library constists of two files:
    logicalElement.h - class and methods
    logicalElement.cpp - implementation
To built Library you need only object-file.
If you want to connect Library to main.cpp (main project) or main.cpp (test-program), you can just use my CMakeLists.txt file.

If there are problems with output to the console, it may be worth changing the encoding of the console.

If you want to run static project, you need to:
1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3-master/
2. Comment or delete "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
3. Re-built the project.

If you want to built library or run tests of dynamic project, you need to:
1. For library:
    1.1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3-master/external/
    1.2. Add "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
    1.3. Re-built library. Be careful not to mix a static project with a dynamic library!
2. For tests:
    2.1. Open CMakeLists.txt in lab3-master/GTESTS/
    2.2. Add "add_compile_definitions(dynamic)"
    2.3. Re-built tests. Be careful not to mix a static tests with a dynamic library or a dynamic tests with a static library!

If you read this, I hope you will suggest more simple way of organisation of that type of programs :)
